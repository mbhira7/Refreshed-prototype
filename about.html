						<h2>Our vision and team</h2>

						<p>
							We are a small but passionate team of 5 individuals. We first met through
							university, and shared the common problem of having difficulties with
							waking up in the morning. As we were brainstorming solutions to this
							problem, we found we all had different preferences for how we would like
							to wake up. Our product concept started becoming bloated with features
							that only some of us found useful. This sparked the idea that would
							become one of the most important parts of our company; The idea that you
							only pay for the features you want to use. It is our belief that this is
							the most effective way to satisfy our customers' needs.
